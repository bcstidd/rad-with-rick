    question: "What is the primary purpose of the aluminum filter in the x-ray tubehead?",
    answer: "Removes low-energy, long-wavelength x-rays",
    options: [
      "Reduces scatter radiation",
      "Increases image sharpness",
      "Removes low-energy, long-wavelength x-rays",
      "Collimates the x-ray beam"
    ],
    explanation: "The aluminum filter absorbs less penetrating x-rays that would increase patient dose without contributing to image quality."
  },
  {
    question: "Which radiograph is best for evaluating interproximal decay?",
    answer: "Bitewing",
    options: [
      "Occlusal",
      "Bitewing",
      "Panoramic",
      "Periapical"
    ],
    explanation: "Bitewings are specifically designed to show the crowns of upper and lower teeth and interproximal areas for detecting caries."

  {
    question: "What causes elongation in dental radiographs?",
    answer: "Vertical angulation too shallow",
    options: [
      "Vertical angulation too steep",
      "Horizontal angulation incorrect",
      "Vertical angulation too shallow",
      "Improper film placement"
    ],
    explanation: "Elongation occurs when the x-ray beam is not steep enough, projecting an extended image of the teeth."

  {
    question: "What is the purpose of a thyroid collar?",
    answer: "Protects the thyroid gland from scatter radiation",
    options: [
      "Improves patient positioning",
      "Reduces film fogging",
      "Protects the thyroid gland from scatter radiation",
      "Reduces motion artifacts"
    ],
    explanation: "The thyroid gland is highly sensitive to radiation, and a thyroid collar helps minimize unnecessary exposure."
  },
  {
    question: "Which radiographic error results in clear areas where no image is present?",
    answer: "Cone cut",
    options: [
      "Double exposure",
      "Overexposure",
      "Cone cut",
      "Developer stain"
    ],
    explanation: "Cone cut occurs when part of the receptor is not exposed to radiation due to improper PID alignment."
  },
  {
    question: "Which tissue type is the least radiosensitive?",
    answer: "Muscle",
    options: [
      "Bone marrow",
      "Intestinal lining",
      "Muscle",
      "Skin"
    ],
    explanation: "Muscle cells are more specialized and divide less frequently, making them less sensitive to ionizing radiation."
  },
  {
    question: "What setting primarily affects radiographic contrast?",
    answer: "Kilovoltage (kVp)",
    options: [
      "Milliamperage (mA)",
      "Exposure time",
      "Kilovoltage (kVp)",
      "Film speed"
    ],
    explanation: "Higher kilovoltage creates more penetrating x-rays and reduces contrast, while lower kVp increases contrast."
  },
  {
    question: "What size film is commonly used for adult periapical radiographs?",
    answer: "Size 2",
    options: [
      "Size 0",
      "Size 1",
      "Size 2",
      "Size 3"
    ],
    explanation: "Size 2 film is the standard choice for adult periapical views because it fits most adult mouths comfortably."
  },
  {
    question: "Which structure appears most radiopaque on dental x-rays?",
    answer: "Enamel",
    options: [
      "Dentin",
      "Cementum",
      "Enamel",
      "Pulp"
    ],
    explanation: "Enamel is the most mineralized and dense structure in the tooth, appearing whitest or most radiopaque."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of radiation is responsible for the majority of x-rays produced in a dental x-ray tube?",
    answer: "Bremsstrahlung radiation",
    options: [
      "Scatter radiation",
      "Characteristic radiation",
      "Bremsstrahlung radiation",
      "Secondary radiation"
    ],
    explanation: "Bremsstrahlung radiation is generated when high-speed electrons slow down near the nucleus of the tungsten target, producing the majority of usable x-rays."
